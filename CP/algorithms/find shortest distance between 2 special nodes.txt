Given an undirected graph with n vertices, m edges and k special nodes, find the shortest distance between 2 
distinct special nodes.





Method 1: randomized

for each special node label as start or end randomly. Connect all start to a source, and all end to a sink, then 
run djikstra

the probability that optimal pair will be seperated is 1/2

if we do that 2 log n times, chance of fail is 1/n (just do more times if n is small)

time complexity: O(m log^2 n)



Method 2: clever partitions

How can we ensure all pairs are seperated at least once? Think binary!

Iterate through the bits. label special nodes with 0 in ith bit as start and with 1 in ith bit as end

because all special nodes are distinct, all pairs must differ in at least 1 bit

time complexity: O(m log^2 n)



Method 3: multi-source djikstra

Run multi-source djikstra from the special nodes, dist[i] = shortest path from i to a special node, head[i] = the 
special node closest to i

For each edge (u, v), if head[u] is not equal to head[v], consider dist[u] + d(u, v) + dist[v] as answer

time complexity: O(m log n)





Harder version: choose 4 distinct special nodes (a, b, c, d) minimize dist(a, b) + dist(c, d)





Method 1: randomized

Make sets A B C D, for each special node put it into a set randomly

run djikstra from A to B and from C to D

chance of success is 1/32

repeat process 32 log n times, chance of failure 1/n

time complexity: O(m log^2 n)



Method 2: smart af

firstly, find the minimum (x, y) using method 3 above

x and y must be part of (a, b, c, d):

	if both don't belong:

		just replace (a, b) with (x, y), will get better answer cuz (x, y) already minimum

	if x is a WLOG:

		replace b with y, will get better answer

2 cases:

	(x, y) is (a, b)

		just repeat method 3 on graph with nodes a and b removed

	(x, y) is (a, c)

		run djikstra from x and y

		obs: must choose node closest to x or second closest to x

		for the 2 options, iterate through special nodes for y
