Graph that can be drawn on the plane in such wat that no edges cross each other.

A graph is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph that is a subdivision of complete graph K(5) or 
complete bipartite graph K(3, 3).

subdivision: change edge ._____. to .__.__. 0 or more times

v - e + f = 2

proof: If graph is not a tree, remove an edge which completes a cycle. This lowers both e and f by 1, so v - e + f 
       stays the same. Repeat until its a tree, and trees and v = e + 1 and f = 1, therefore v - e + f = 2.

Any face is bounded by at least 3 edges and every edge touches at most 2 faces. Therefore, if v >= 3, e <= 3v - 6.

Average degree < 6

maximal planar graph: it is planar but adding any edge would destroy the property.
all triangles, 3v - 6 edges and 2v - 4 faces

every planar graph is 4-colourable
