dfs 1: calculate subtree sizes and label heavy nodes

par[n]: parent of node i

heavy[n]: node that is heavy

depth[n]: depth of node i

size[n]: size of subtree of node i

dfs 2: decompose the tree into disjoint paths

head[n]: the head of the chain node i is in

pos[n]: the position of node i in segment tree
