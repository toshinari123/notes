Vertices van be divided into 2 disjoint and independant sets U and V such that every edge connects a vertex in U 
yo one in V.

Does not contain odd cycles.

Hypercube graphs, partial cubes, and median graphs are bipartite. In these graphs, the vertices may be labeled by 
bitvectors, in such a way that two vertices are adjacent if and only if the corresponding bitvectors differ in a 
single position. A bipartition may be formed by separating the vertices whose bitvectors have an even number of 
ones from the vertices with an odd number of ones. Trees and squaregraphs form examples of median graphs, and every
median graph is a partial cube.

The median of three bitvectors a, b, and c may be calculated by computing, in each bit position, the majority 
function of the bits of a, b, and c.

I(a,b) = {v | d(a,b) = d(a,v) + d(v,b)}

A median graph is defined by the property that, for every three vertices a, b, and c, these intervals intersect in 
a single point:

    For all a, b, and c, |I(a,b) ∩ I(a,c) ∩ I(b,c)| = 1.
